# BalloonKit WMS ðŸŽˆ
A specialized Warehouse Management System (WMS) built for the unique challenges of balloon kit stores selling on marketplaces.

## Overview
Generic WMS solutions fail to address the specific operational needs of a balloon kit business. **BalloonKit WMS** is a specialized alternative that provides tailored tools for accuracy, efficiency, and scalability in this niche. It handles everything from complex kit building to multi-supplier inventory tracking out of the box.

## Key Features
- **Non-Trackable Item Support:** Native handling of items that lack barcodes or standard identifiers.
- **Alternate SKU Management:** Track identical inventory items sourced from multiple suppliers, each with their own cost and lead time.
- **Intelligent Kit Building (Kitting):** Create virtual products (kits) from raw components. The system automatically reserves inventory and deducts all kit components upon order fulfillment, preventing stock discrepancies.
- **Real-time Inventory Tracking:** Always know what's in stock and where it's located.
- **Marketplace Integration Ready:** Designed to work seamlessly with popular e-commerce platforms.

## Tech Stack
- **Backend:** C#, .NET 8
- **Frontend:** Windows Forms
- **ORM:** Entity Framework
- **Database:** SQL Server / SQLite
